Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.


Why?  Because the first principle of the Agile Manifesto is so easy to break.  We broke it big time and learned a lot when fixing it.

Tools like Jira seduce you into building a mammoth process</summary>

    <summary type="html">The following is a story about how we matured as an engineering team.  We went from an ad-hoc process to Scrum, and used Scrum for a whole year.  Scrum leveled us up as a team in terms of structure and process.  But it caused major morale issues.  Then we found Kanban.  We implemented it and have never looked back.

They are here for the life of the company.

    <summary type="html">When you look at an object dependency graph, it&amp;rsquo;s not 100% clear how to read it.  When one object points to another,
what does that mean exactly?

An object is said to depend on another object in the following scenarios:


When an object knows the name of another object
When an object knows the name of a method of another object, and knows the arguments that method takes


The first is quite easy to recognize and if you have that first dependency level, you implicitly have the second.  If at
all possible, you want to strive towards the second point.

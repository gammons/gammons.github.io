<p><strong>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why?  Because the first principle of the Agile Manifesto is <em>so easy</em> to break.  We broke it big time and learned a lot when fixing it.</p>

<p>Tools like Jira seduce you into building a mammoth process that is convoluted and hard to convey to your team.  You get blinded by the allure of super-sweet metrics and charts.  And so the thought goes:  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know our burndown rate and velocity, and it will all be on this pretty graph, and we&rsquo;ll put it up on the wall TV, and we shall revel in our newfound measurements!  Everyone will be on the same page then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So you set up a wild and crazy workflow process, implement it for your team, and wait for those charts to just look freaking awesome on your wall TV.</p>

<p>But, that doesn&rsquo;t actually happen.  How do I know?  We traversed this path as a team.  It was a path that led to unhappiness.</p>

<h2>Slimming down the processes and tools</h2>

<p>We were heavy Jira users for about 2 years.  Jira&rsquo;s a great tool for someone, but it turned out to be a very bad tool for us.  All the developers hated it.  Our PM didn&rsquo;t trust it.  It was slow and enterprisey feeling.</p>

<p><strong>There were bugs in the process.</strong>  Developers and the PM consistently got tickets &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in a state where they could not move them without an administrator&rsquo;s help.   Tickets would consistently fail to automatically move based upon some external stimuli.   Every month, we&rsquo;d have to groom Jira to ensure tickets were in the right state, because we couldn&rsquo;t trust the system.</p>

<p><strong>We were never able to actually reconcile stories and tasks</strong>  The PM really wanted to see stories moving across rather than tasks.  Because of how Jira is architected, we needed a totally separate workflow and boards for stories vs tasks.  Therefore, we&rsquo;d consistently be in states where all the tasks were completed but the story was not.  This lead to a lot of consternation and mistrust of the tool.  Each morning before standups, I would have to &ldquo;reconcile&rdquo; the stories to match the task states daily.  Yes, I attempted to use some automations here but my automations had bugs as well.</p>

<p>We limped along like this for almost 2 years.  Jira followed us from our [transition from Scrum to Kanban][1].  I would consistently hear from the engineers that Jira was the bane of their existence.  The PM also hated it because he couldn&rsquo;t figure out the status of a story.  So here we had a tool that didn&rsquo;t function well and <em>nobody</em> was getting a benefit from.  It was time for a change.</p>

<h3>Moving foward</h3>

<p>Finally fed up with all of this, I called everyone into a room and we decided to do a hard reset.  I did a lot of research, talking with team leads, the PM, and the VP of product.  We decided to strip everything down to the studs and <strong>only add enough tooling to get the job done.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The board is imperative to using kanban and understanding the state of a story&rsquo;s development</li>
<li>Because we&rsquo;re a remote team, we need an &lsquo;online&rsquo; board.</li>
</ul>

<p>But that&rsquo;s all we needed.  Anything more and we were afraid it would be overkill and start to introduce the same warts that our previous tool and process had.</p>

<p><strong>We decided to use Trello for our board.</strong> Why trello?  Because it was the lightest-weight tool we could find that met our criteria.  Everyone understood it, and there was no heavy-duty &ldquo;workflow&rdquo; to get riddled with bugs.  It was like a breath of fresh air compared to the much more draconian Jira.</p>

<h2>Favoring individuals and interactions</h2>

<p>Trello doesn&rsquo;t have a way of measuring velocity automatically.  We factored this in when moving, but came to an interesting realization about &ldquo;agile metrics&rdquo; in general.</p>

<p><strong>We decided to ditch the &ldquo;agile metrics&rdquo; and favor overcommunication instead.</strong>  We lost Jira&rsquo;s charts and metrics, but given the bugs in our process, those never reflected reality anyways.   Also, I didn&rsquo;t know who the metrics were for.  Were they for me?  Our PM?  Our CEO?  Not really. What I care about is fostering a happy, productive team.  Our PM cares about shipping high quality software on time.  Our CEO cares about the company being successful as a whole.</p>

<p>Perhaps these metrics are there to ensure your developers are actually working.  Maybe I am a minority, but <strong>I trust my engineers</strong>.  They are a bunch of hard working, super smart folks.  The proof of their awesomeness is in the list of stuff they have shipped in the last 12 months.  [And that&rsquo;s even with having Investment Time every friday][2].</p>

<p><strong>Substitute knowing your velocity for just having a conversation.</strong>  I don&rsquo;t know my team&rsquo;s velocity.   Instead, I have conversations with the team leads and the PM to ensure a project is going to be delivered on time.  If it isn&rsquo;t, we have a conversation about why not, and then we <em>overcommunicate that to the rest of the company</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not only about project updates.  We&rsquo;ll communicate <em>everything</em>:  Technical challenges we overcame, who stayed up late, who&rsquo;s crushing it.  Also, we&rsquo;ll talk about not so awesome stuff as well.  We&rsquo;ll talk about the blip of downtime or the elevated error rates we saw + fixed.  I&rsquo;ll use paragraphs rather than charts.</p>

<p>These types of updates are so much better than just saying &ldquo;our team&rsquo;s velocity is 53, which is 4 points more than last week!&rdquo;  If that&rsquo;s your update, what happens when the velocity tanks?  You&rsquo;ll get a lot of funny looks.   Even if your update does include more context than the number, everyone&rsquo;s going to be focusing on the number rather than the story.  Focus on the story instead.</p>

<p>There are plenty of &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; tools and metrics out there.  Beware - hey can get away from you, at the cost of your team&rsquo;s happiness.  Tools like Jira make it <em>amazingly easy</em> to break the first priniple of Agile.</p>

<p>Keep it simple. Have conversations. Write paragraphs. Overcommunicate.  Don&rsquo;t let the tool replace those.</p>
